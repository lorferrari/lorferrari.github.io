Hello everybody! I’m Lorenzo, and welcome to my website project.  
The idea behind this website comes from my passion for fitness. My goal was to design a modern and good-looking gym website, including all the sections that I believe are essential for this kind of websites. 
Inside the project folder, there are two HTML files and their corresponding CSS files. 
“index.html” and “mystyle.css” correspond to the main homepage, containing all the key sections and their styles. 
While “join.html” and “join.css” correspond to the webpage which is linked to the “Join” and “Sign Up” buttons found on the main website. Basically, it serves as the sign-up page for new members.
The presentation is located in the folder “Presentation Titanium Gym”. Regarding the presentation, I’ve started writing it in markdown and then I’ve used Pandoc to automatically convert it into an HTML presentation.
In the “imgs” folder there are all the images I’ve used on the website, while the “imgs-md” folder contains all the images I’ve included in the presentation. 
The “videos” folder contains the video I’ve used in the hero section of the homepage.
I hope you enjoy my website. Thank you!
