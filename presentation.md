### Introduction

The idea behind this website was inspired by my passion for fitness. The goal was not just to design a good-looking website, but also create one which looks informative, motivating and true to what someone would expect from a real gym website.  
I wanted to provide information about:  

- subscriptions plans available to members  
- trainers working in the gym and their skills  
- showcasing gym facilities  
- the location

### Coulour Palette and Visual
Before I even started creating the HTML structure, I've selected a coulour palette that could reflect the identity of a gym. In some sections, I chose dark and bolder tones to create a sense of power, motivation and determination; qualities that lie at the core of physical training. In contrast, in some other sections I've used lighter colours to balance the overall design.

### Navigation Bar and Header
I've decided to put the navigation bar at the top of the page, using the semantic "nav" element along with "ul" and "li" to structure the menu items. Additionally, I've included the "a" tag so that when a user clicks on a menu option, the website automatically jumps to the corresponding section they've selected.

### Hero Video
On the main homepage, I've decided to use a full-screen video because I wanted the website to be more dynamic. It's also possible to see the slogan of Titanium Gym.
 My intention was to combine the motion of the video and the slogan to:

- capture viewer's attention
- convey the energy and spirit of the gym
-  give the website a modern and engaging feel.

### Containers
The goal of this website is to increase gym's visibility and effectively showcase all the services it offers. 
I wanted the users to easily compare, analyze, and understand the available services in a clear, organized, and polished manner. 
For this reason, in both the Membership and Trainer sections, I've decided to present the information using card-style containers, which provide a horizontal visually structured and user-friendly layout.

### Join and Sign Up Buttons
The Join and Sign Up buttons guide users toward becoming members of Titanium Gym. 
These buttons are linked to the "join.html" page, where users can complete the registration by entering their personal information.

### Symmetrical Gallery Section
I've designed the gallery section to showcase gym's facilities and equipment. The images are structured in a symmetrical grid, creating balance and order. 
This layout feels both modern and elegant, while also making it easy for users to view the content very quickly.

### The About Us Section
The "About Us" Section was designed to provide visitors a deep understanding of Titanium Gym's mission, values and identity, emphasizing that fitness is not just a routine but a lifestyle.

### Locating the Gym easily
I've included the "Map Section" at the end of the website by embedding a Google Maps iframe to help users easily locate the gym. 
This interactive feature improve user experience by allowing visitors to find the gym directly on the website, without having to leave the website, which is an expected feature in modern websites.

### Footer
In the end, I've created the footer which serves as the bottom section of the website, providing a clear and consistent closing element. 
It includes a copyright notice and the goal was to inform users that the website's content is owned by Titanium Gym.

### Join Titanium Gym World
I wanted to create an interactive website in which, when a user clicks on "Join" or "Sign Up", they will be directed to a form page where they can enter their information to join Titanium Gym World. The form allows users to provide: First Name, Last Name, Email, Credit or Debit Card information, and Birthday.
